# Image-Classification-Using-CNN
Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules.
Convolutional neural networks are deep artificial neural networks. We use CNN to classify images, cluster them by similarity ,and perform object recognition within scenes.

MATLAB provides the ideal environment for deep learning, through to model training and
deployment.

● Deep Learning Toolbox implements a framework for composing and performing deep neural networks with algorithms, trained models, and applications.

● The Image Processing Toolbox provides a set of functions and applications for image processing, analysis, and visualization.

● Computer vision tool box is used to make computer vision-related machine learning
models for tasks like facial recognition, image classiϐication, object detection, and more.

● MatConvNet is a process of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) execution for MATLAB. The toolbox is originated with an emphasis on simplicity and ϐlexibility.
